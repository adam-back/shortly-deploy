#shortly-deploy
This is a project I completed as a student at [Hack Reactor](http://hackreactor.com). This project was worked on with a pair.

Apparently neither of us saved our work, though. The two goals of this project were to:
1. Deploy this site on Azure.
2. Learn Grunt.
3. Refactor the DB to MongoDB.

For deployment and MongoDB, read a blog I wrote on [deploying a MEAN stack app](http://www.adam-back.com/deploy-a-mean-app-on-azure/).

See my work with Gulp on [jobQuery](https://github.com/jobquery-enhance/jobquery-client).
